# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Unzip the folder into a regular folder ->
Open the folder (recipe-app) in Visual Studio ->
In the terminal, run 'npm run dev' ->
Copy the Localhost URL and open it :)

!!! If Vite is not installed ->
In CMD -> cd into recipe-app -> npm install vite@latest
